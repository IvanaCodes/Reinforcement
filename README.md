This project implements a Q-learning algorithm to navigate an agent through a grid-based environment. The environment includes both terminal and non-terminal states, and the agent uses a stochastic policy to explore and learn the optimal actions that maximize rewards. The Q-learning algorithm is used to update the agentâ€™s policy based on exploration and reward feedback from the environment.
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
